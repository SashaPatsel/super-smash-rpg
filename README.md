Super Smash Bros Game is an RPG Strategy Game.

When you start, you can pick any of the four players on the screen. 

Once you've chosen your character, you can pick an opponent to fight against. In the example below, Mario was chosen as player 1, and the first opponent to fight is DK. 

When you defeat an opponent, you can pick from any of the remaining foes. 

You win if you vanquish all the availbale enemies. Watch out though. If your health falls below 0, you lose.

## Notes
- This is my first project using JQuery. I found it to be a very refreshing change from vanilla javascript. JQuery makes it a lot more straightforward to identify elements on the DOM and to manipulate them
